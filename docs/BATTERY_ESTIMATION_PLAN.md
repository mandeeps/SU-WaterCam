## 1. Hardware Context

### Power chain

```
Solar panel
    │  (solar input cable, ~6–20V)
    ▼
Voltaic V50 battery pack
    │  (regulated 5V USB-C output)
    │  └─ D+ pin carries ½ × cell voltage (~1.5–2.1V, varies with SOC)
    ▼
WittyPi 4 (USB-C input)
    │  (5V via GPIO header)
    ▼
Raspberry Pi
```

### What WittyPi 4 can measure

| Command | What it reads | Useful for SOC? |
|---|---|---|
| `get_input_voltage` | VIN pin (XH2.54) | **No** — reads regulated 5V, constant regardless of charge |
| `get_output_voltage` | 5V rail to RPi | **No** — regulated by WittyPi DC/DC |
| `get_output_current` | Current to RPi | No — load current, not battery level |

### Voltaic V50 D+ signal (key finding)

Voltaic V25/V50/V75 battery packs output a **scaled cell voltage on the USB-C D+ data pin**:

```
D+ voltage ≈ cell_voltage / 2
```

| Battery state | Cell voltage | D+ voltage |
|---|---|---|
| Full | 4.2 V | ~2.10 V |
| Empty (cutoff) | 3.0 V | ~1.50 V |
| Observed full (empirical) | ~3.7 V | ~1.85 V |
| Observed empty (empirical) | ~3.08 V | ~1.54 V |

The theoretical range is 1.5–2.1 V. Empirical user measurements show 1.54–1.85 V, suggesting the pack's protection circuit cuts off before full cell voltage is reached. The LiPo formula applied to the reconstructed cell voltage is valid for this signal.

**This eliminates the need for coulomb counting.** SOC is read directly on every boot — no accumulated drift, no state file, no power-path interruption.

## 2. Problems to Fix

| # | Problem | Severity | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Wrong voltage source: LiPo formula applied to regulated 5V WittyPi VIN | Critical | `ticktalk_main.py:1576` |
| B | LoRa path never reads live battery status — `battery_percent` hardcoded or absent | High | `tools/lora_transmit.py`, callers |
| C | Silent omission when reading fails — receiver can't distinguish 0% from unavailable | Medium | `ticktalk_main.py:1575` |
| D | Voltage-to-percent logic inline and duplicated across transmit paths | Low | all transmit paths |

---

## 3. Solution

### Primary: ADS1115 + D+ pin

Read the Voltaic V50's D+ pin using an **Adafruit ADS1115** 16-bit ADC over I2C.

**Why ADS1115 over direct GPIO:**
- Raspberry Pi has no built-in ADC; GPIO pins are digital only
- ADS1115 provides 16-bit resolution at ±2.048 V range → ~62.5 µV/LSB
- Over the ~0.31 V empirical D+ span: ~4,960 usable steps (ample precision)
- Already on I2C bus shared with AHT20 and BNO085; no new bus needed
- Adafruit STEMMA QT — no soldering

**SOC formula:**
```python
cell_v = d_plus_v * 2.0
batt_pct = max(0, min(100, int((cell_v - CELL_V_MIN) / (CELL_V_MAX - CELL_V_MIN) * 100)))
```

Where `CELL_V_MIN = 3.0 V`, `CELL_V_MAX = 4.2 V`. These constants are tunable once empirical D+ readings are collected from the deployed unit.

### Fallback: no hardware

When ADS1115 is absent (or D+ wire not connected):
- Return `battery_pct = None`, `battery_source = "unavailable"`
- Omit channel `02 01` from packets — receiver treats as unknown
- Log WittyPi VIN for cable-fault diagnostics only (do not compute SOC from it)

## 4. Hardware BOM

| Component | Adafruit Product | Qty | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ADS1115 16-bit ADC breakout | #1085 | 1 | I2C addr 0x48; STEMMA QT |
| USB-C breakout board | #4090 | 1 | Exposes D+, D−, VBUS, GND pins |
| STEMMA QT cable | #4210 | 1 | ADS1115 → RPi I2C header |
| 22 AWG wire | — | ~10 cm | D+ from USB-C breakout to ADS1115 AIN0 |

**Wiring:**
```
Voltaic V50 USB-C output
    │
    ▼
USB-C breakout board
    ├─ VBUS (5V) ──► WittyPi USB-C input (power path unchanged)
    ├─ GND ──────► Common GND
    └─ D+ ───────► ADS1115 AIN0

ADS1115
    ├─ AIN0 ──► D+ (as above)
    ├─ GND ───► Common GND
    ├─ SDA ───► RPi GPIO 2 (I2C1 SDA)  [shared with AHT20, BNO085]
    └─ SCL ───► RPi GPIO 3 (I2C1 SCL)
```

The USB-C breakout sits in-line on the USB-C cable from the Voltaic V50 to the WittyPi. VBUS/GND carry power as normal; D+ is tapped for ADC reading only (high-impedance, no load on the signal).

## 5. Software Architecture

### `tools/battery_manager.py`

```
get_battery_status() → dict
    battery_pct:      int | None      (0–100, or None if unavailable)
    battery_source:   str             ("ads1115_dplus" | "unavailable")
    cell_voltage_v:   float | None    (reconstructed cell voltage, V)
    d_plus_v:         float | None    (raw D+ reading, V)

_read_ads1115_dplus() → float | None
    Read AIN0 from ADS1115 at ±2.048V gain.
    Returns voltage in V, or None if hardware absent.

_cell_voltage_to_pct(cell_v: float) → int
    Apply LiPo formula clamped [0, 100].

_log_wittypi_vin_diagnostic() → None
    Log WittyPi get_input_voltage for cable-fault detection only.
```

### Changes to existing files

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `ticktalk_main.py` (×2 LoRa data blocks) | Replace WittyPi battery_voltage block with `battery_manager.get_battery_status()` |
| `ticktalk_main.py` (IP uplink, ~line 1573) | Replace inline LiPo formula with `battery_manager.get_battery_status()` |
| `tools/lora_transmit.py` | Guard `battery_percent` with `is not None` check (already done) |
| `tools/lora_handler_concurrent.py` | Same None guard (already done) |

## 6. Implementation Steps

- [x] Create GitHub issue #46
- [x] Create branch `feature/issue-46-battery-estimation`
- [x] Write `tools/battery_manager.py` (initial INA260 version)
- [x] Fix IP uplink and LoRa paths in `ticktalk_main.py`
- [x] Fix `lora_transmit.py` and `lora_handler_concurrent.py` None guard
- [x] Write `tests/test_battery_manager.py` (14 tests passing)
- [x] Revise `battery_manager.py` to use ADS1115 + D+ (replaces INA260/coulomb counting)
- [ ] Deploy hardware and collect empirical D+ readings to tune `CELL_V_MIN`/`CELL_V_MAX`
- [ ] Update `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`

## 7. Out of Scope

- Measuring solar recharge current (D+ reads instantaneous SOC; recharge is implicit)
- Distinguishing charging vs discharging state (would need D− or CC pin monitoring)
- Automatic wake-on-low-battery (WittyPi low-voltage threshold handles this via VIN)

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

1. `battery_pct` in packets reflects D+ derived cell SOC when ADS1115 is present
2. When ADS1115 absent, battery channel omitted from packet (not silently wrong)
3. `battery_source` field always present in status dict
4. No LiPo formula applied to regulated WittyPi VIN voltage anywhere in codebase
5. LoRa and IP paths both use `battery_manager.get_battery_status()`
6. All tests pass; ADS1115 absence does not crash the system
