# Build Guide / How To

### Project requires a Raspberry Pi or compatible single board computer
running Linux.

If using a Pi Zero, install the headers if it doesn't ship with them attached

    or better

* Stemma QT cable to connect Adafruit thermal sensor to headers

    https://www.adafruit.com/product/4397

    If using a different thermal sensor (like the Flir Lepton) get needed
    cables or breakout boards for it. Source code will need to be modified
    to use the appropriate library for that sensor.

* Battery
    https://voltaicsystems.com/v50/ or other battery. I like Voltaic battery
    packs for this since they do not auto-shutdown during low power draw, 
    which is important for this system as it will be in low-power mode most 
    of the time and losing power then would prevent it from starting back up. 

    Make sure to have a way to connect whatever battery you are using to the 
    WittyPi. If using a plain lipo battery instead of a USB power bank like 
    the Voltaic get a charger that will also let you connect the battery to 
    the microUSB port on the WittyPi like 

    https://www.adafruit.com/product/2465

    You'll need to solder the included USB header on or else solder a micro USB cable
    to the output so it can be connected to the WittyPi
    If you use a regular USB power bank / portable phone charger you'll need
    to adjust some WittyPi settings so it draws more power when the RPi is off to
    avoid the power bank shutting off all power. This will of course decrease
    battery life. 

* MicroSD card
* micro USB cables, at least one for setup, preferably 2 so you can test with the WittyPi attached


### Raspberry Pi 4 with Flir camera, IMU, and Quectel Cellular modem+GPS
Ideally we will have an image that can be flashed onto an SD card for new builds.

Installation from scratch: Use Raspberry Pi Imager to install current stable 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS lite to a microSD card with SSH enabled in the configuration options, along with the user account name and password. After flashing, add enable_uart=1 at the end of the /boot/config.txt file. Insert the SD card in the Pi, attach power and boot it up.

Use a serial cable to connect to the console and use sudo raspi-config to configure the device settings (locale, timezone, GPU memory, predictable network names, etc.,) and select Network Manager in place of dhcpcd in networking settings.
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable/software-installation-windows


Use sudo nmtui to configure the ethernet connection to a static IP, with your computer IP as the gateway and DNS server if you are sharing your Internet connection with the Pi. Otherwise configure for whatever network setup you have.
Now you can use ssh to login to the Pi after connecting it to your computer with an ethernet cable. Connection sharing can be setup using Network Manager on a Linux computer, or Windows Connection sharing, or the macOS equivalent.

Once you've logged in and are sharing an internet connection from your computer to the Pi, run sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade

Helpful tools: sudo apt install git tmux
Install your preferred editor, which should be neovim, and aptitude if you want a TUI for apt

Set /boot/config.txt options:
# Disable LEDs to save power
dtparam=act_led_trigger=none
dtparam=act_led_activelow=off
dtparam=pwr_led_activelow=off
dtparam=eth_led0=14
dtparam=eth_led1=14

# disable audio
dtparam=audio=off

# disable wireless, we won't use WiFi or Bluetooth
dtoverlay=disable-wifi
dtoverlay=disable-bt
dtoverlay=pi3-disable-wifi
dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt

# Add to /boot/cmdline.txt
spidev.bufsiz=131072   for Flir camera

Comment out the DRM VC4 V3D driver so we can use tvservice -o to shutdown HDMI output and save power.

# SD Card settings
Disable swap and set noatime to prolong SD card life: sudo swapoff --all, sudo apt purge dphys-swapfile.

Add noatime, commit=60 settings to ext4 partitions in /etc/fstab - noatime prevents writing access times to files, commit collects and delays writes to every N seconds. Data loss will be limited to the last N seconds of writes if power is lost. Do NOT change the /boot partition settings, it is a vfat filesystem and these options will not work and will cause the Pi to not boot.

Set temp directories like /tmp, /var/tmp to mount in RAM, ex. tmpfs /var/tmp tmpfs nodev,nosuid,size=20M 0 0 in fstab

# Power Management
Next, configure the WittyPi 3 Mini for power management.
Download: wget http://www.uugear.com/repo/WittyPi3/install.sh
Install: sudo sh install.sh
Reboot, then run wittyPi.sh from the wittypi directory to configure the schedule.

# SU-WaterCam setup
Clone the public git repo: https://github.com/mandeeps/SU-WaterCam.git
Compile lepton.c and capture.c for the device. cd to the SU-WaterCam/tools directory and run: 
gcc lepton.c -o lepton
gcc capture.c -o capture

Copy to the root of the SU-WaterCam directory. From tools, run "cp lepton ../." and "cp capture ../."

use apt to install these packages: sudo apt install libgpiod-dev python3-pandas python3-dev python3-venv exempi python3-wheel

We need to use virtual environments for Python on Debian-derivatives like Raspberry Pi OS starting with Debian 12 (codenamed Bookworm). 
As of 6-20-23 Debian 11 remains the current stable base for Raspberry Pi OS, but let's future proof by using a venv now.
Create a virtual environment with python -m venv --system-site-packages /home/pi/SU-WaterCam/venv, (we use system-site-packages to copy over pandas and other modules)
activate with source /home/pi/SU-WaterCam/venv/bin/activate, and then install modules with pip install -r /home/pi/SU-WaterCam/requirements.txt
or manually with pip install compress_pickle adafruit-blinka gpiozero piexif picamera2 py-gpsd2 python-xmp-toolkit

If using MLX90640 thermal sensor also install: adafruit_circuitpython-mlx90640
If using MPU6050 IMU install: adafruit_circuitpython_mpu6050

# If using MPU6050:
Change the WittyPi 3 i2c address to avoid a conflict. The WittyPi 3 uses 0x68 for the RTC, and 0x69 for its microcontroller. The RTC address cannot be changed, but the microcontroller address can. The MPU6050 uses 0x68 by default. First solder the connection on the back of the MPU6050 board to change its i2c address to 0x69. Then change the WittyPi 3 microcontroller i2c address to something else, like 0x70 by following the instructions in the manual. WittyPi 4 does not require this.

Change the Witty Pi 3 microcontroller I2C address: i2cset -y 1 0x69 9 0x70
Edit the utilities.sh file in the wittypi directory and change I2C_MC_ADDRESS=0x69 to 0x70
Then shutdown the system: sudo halt
Disconnect the power to the wittypi 3, reconnect it, start the system up
Check the i2c settings changed: i2cdetect -y 1
Run the wittypi script to verify ./wittypi/wittyPi.sh

# Quectel GPS
sudo apt install gpsd gpsd-clients

Remove and purge udhcpcd and openresolv: sudo apt purge udhcpcd openresolv
Reconfigure current network devices with network manager to retain local networking during setup - sudo nmtui is easiest way
Make sure /etc/network/interfaces has no references to devices you want NM to manage

Then configure cellular modem and verify everything works as expected after restarts
sudo mmcli -m 0 --simple-connect='apn=iot.1nce.net' Replace apn as appropriate

Setup connection in NetworkManager: sudo nmcli c add type gsm ifname cdc-wdm0 con-name Quectel apn iot.1nce.net


sudo mmcli -m 0 â€“-location-enable-gps-unmanaged -- to tell ModemManager to start the GPS on the Quectel EC25 but not control it, so gpsd can manage it instead

enable gps.service in the git config directory so this will be done automatically on boot

Edit /etc/default/gpsd to set the correct gps device, in this case /dev/ttyUSB1


Then in python we can get gps data:
import gpsd2
gpsd2.connect()
packet = gpsd2.get_current()
print(packet.position())

# Flir Lepton Breakout board wiring
7 female-female cables needed

Orient the back of the breakout board towards yourself. The front is the side with the socket for the Lepton camera.
Let's call the pins that are closest to you pins 1 through 10, starting from the left going to the right. Right is the side with the mini ZIF connector on top (the white plastic bit above the QR code sticker)
Let's call the pins on the bottom (away from you) pins A through J
Pin 1 is for power, so wire that to the 3V3 power pin on the Pi. See the Flir Lepton Wiring image for help.
We can use the top pin of the two pins without jumpers on the back of the board (side towards you right now) for ground. In other words, the pin with nothing covering it that is closest to the white ZIF socket towards the top is the ground pin, so connect it to the ground pin on the Pi.

Because we need I2C for other peripherals, use splitter cables for the two I2C pins on the Pi. So get or make two cables that each have a female header on one end and a male and female header on the other end. One female end connects to a pin on the Raspberry Pi GPIO header, and the other two ends are for the Flir breakout board and a peripheral like the Adafruit IMU.

The SDA pin on the Pi (pin #3) will connect to pin C on the breakout board
The SCL pin on the Pi (pin #5) will connect to pin 4 on the breakout board
MOSI on the Pi (pin 19) connects to pin E on the breakout
MISO (pin 21) connect to pin 6
CLK pin on the Pi (GPIO 11, physical pin #23) will connect to pin D on the breakout
CS pin (pin 24, right across from CLK, aka CE0 GPIO 8) connects to pin 5

Insert the Flir camera into the breakout board.
Check everything is correct by running capture and lepton in SU-WaterCam: 
./capture

# Pytorch
pip install torch (in the venv)


### Pi Zero Instructions 
Written assuming you are using a Raspberry Pi Zero with headers installed
and the Adafruit MLX90640 sensor

Flash the provided disk image onto the microSD card if not already done

If installing regular Raspbian/RaspberryPi OS image:
in raspi-config set timezone, enable camera, ssh and i2c, set static IP address, reduce GPU memory to 128 minimum for optical camera, change default password, etc.,
use apt to install python3-pandas and libgpiod-dev: sudo apt install libgpiod-dev python3-pandas

Create a virtual environment with python -m venv --system-site-packages /home/pi/SU-WaterCam/venv, activate with source /home/pi/SU-WaterCam/venv/bin/activate, and then install modules with pip install -r /home/pi/SU-WaterCam/requirements.txt
or manually use pip to install dependencies: python3 -m pip install compress_pickle adafruit-blinka adafruit_circuitpython-mlx90640 gpiozero adafruit_circuitpython_mpu6050

If using SD card image provided this should already have been done for you!
Insert into the micrSD card slot on the Raspberry Pi

It's easier to connect the optical camera before installing the WittyPi
Be careful with the connector and the cable, IME ribbon cables and ZIF
sockets are way too fragile. While the cable can flex it should not be folded. Be careful
you don't break the socket clip by using too much force.
For the RPi Zero you'll want to replace any cable
included with the camera with the correct RPi Zero camera cable

Insert the larger end of the RPi camera ribbon cable into the optical camera by gently
pulling the black plastic clip out and inserting the cable in, making sure
the exposed side with the gold pins is facing down. Secure the cable by
pusing the plastic clip back in.

Now on the Raspberry Pi end, gently pull forward the black plastic clip on the CSI camera connector
Insert the cable into the connector making sure the exposed side is down
Push the black plastic clip back into place

Install stacking header onto the Raspberry Pi header making sure it is
firmly in place

Install WittyPi 3 Mini onto the extended headers making sure it is in place

Once the WittyPi is installed you can connect your thermal sensor
See the reference Raspberry Pi Zero image

Connect the Stemma QT cable to the Adafruit MLX90640 sensor, either socket works

Connect the red header cable to pin 1, the 3.3v pin on the top left

Connect the blue header cable to pin 3, the GPIO data pin just below pin 1

Connect the yellow header cable to pin 5, the GPIO clock pin just below pin 3

Connect the black header cable to pin 6, the Ground pin just right of pin 5

Make sure your battery is charged.
Connect the battery to the WittyPi micro USB port. Either directly with a 
cable if using a Voltaic power pack, or through the charger if using a lipo battery.
Press the button on the WittyPi to check if everything turns on. Check the LEDs

Log into the Pi and use the WittyPi program to set the schedule (and increase idle power use if using a normal power bank that isn't intended for IoT devices/doesn't have an always-on mode. Voltaic batteries should not need this.)

If you have a computer set up to connect to the RPi Zero using USB-OTG networking

https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/ethernet-gadget

https://artivis.github.io/post/2020/pi-zero/

you can plug a micro USB cable into the data port of the RPi (the middle port of the three)
and the other end into your computer. Assuming your computer configuration is correct you
should be able to use SSH to access the Zero. If you are not using a Zero
you'll need to use a serial connection to connect to the Pi or configure ethernet or wifi networking on the Pi to SSH in.
Or just plug in a monitor and keyboard.

Once everything is tested and configured, package it up in a water-resistant container and deploy. 
The Voltaic V50 battery ran for over a week in my test, with the above configuration.
It would likely have run longer but I cut the test short.
