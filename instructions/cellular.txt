Easiest way seems to be to use modemmanger with network-manager
This requires replacing Raspbian's default stack of dhcpcd and openresolv
Remove and purge udhcpcd and openresolv: sudo apt purge udhcpcd openresolv
Reconfigure current network devices with network manager to retain local networking during setup - sudo nmtui is easiest way
Make sure /etc/network/interfaces has no references to devices you want NM to manage

Then configure cellular modem and verify everything works as expected after restarts
